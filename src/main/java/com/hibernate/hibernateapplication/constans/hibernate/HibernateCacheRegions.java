    These are used to validate the results as they are served from the query cache.

    If you configure your underlying cache implementation to use expiration,
    itâ€™s very important that the timeout of the underlying cache region
    for the default-update-timestamps-region is set to a higher value than the timeout setting of any of the query caches.

    In fact, we recommend that the default-update-timestamps-region region is not configured
    for expiration (time-based) or eviction (size/memory-based) at all.
    Note that an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction policy is never appropriate for this particular cache region.
